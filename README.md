# Getting Started in 'ML-Audio'
Suggestions for students.

## About
Audio and acoustics students sometimes ask "How do I get started learning  machine learning?"  Not everyone gets their start in a major research environment, so this page is intended to serve as a series of suggestions for those who may find themselves "on their own" in their interest in this area.  It was started by @drscotthawley and [Ryan Miller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-miller-1aa8355a/), but is intended to serve and evolve with the community. 

- ***This is a collaborative page. Please suggest additions, re-organizations, edits, updates, etc., either via Issues or Pull Requests.***  *(In addition, @drscotthawley may gladly cede control of this content to whichever student or group wants to Wiki-fy it!)*

## Active Practictioners to Follow
Many of us learn about and contribue to news of new developments, papers, conferences, grants, and networking opportunities via [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com).

* [Audio ML Twitter list](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1260142677884121088) by Fabian-Robert Stöter (@faroit).  **<-- Follow these people!**


## Quick Quotes
* [Justin Salomon](https://twitter.com/justin_salamon/status/1202016519720300545): "Anyone working in ML, *anyone*, should be *obliged* to curate a dataset before they're allowed to train a single model. The lessons learnt in the process are invaluable, and the dangers of skipping said lessons are manifold (see what I did there?)"
